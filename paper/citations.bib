In this paper, we provide a current picture of the rapidly evolving quantum computing landscape by comparing four software platforms - Forest ({pyQuil}), Qiskit, {ProjectQ}, and the Quantum Developer Kit (Q\#) - that enable researchers to use real and simulated quantum devices. Our analysis covers requirements and installation, language syntax through example programs, library support, and quantum simulator capabilities for each platform. For platforms that have quantum computer support, we compare hardware, quantum assembly languages, and quantum compilers. We conclude by covering features of each and briefly mentioning other quantum computing software packages.},

	abstract     = {Quantum computing ({QC}) is an emerging computational paradigm that leverages the laws of quantum mechanics to perform elementary logic operations. Existing programming models for {QC} were designed with fault-tolerant hardware in mind, envisioning stand-alone applications. However, the susceptibility of near-term quantum computers to noise limits their stand-alone utility. To better leverage limited computational strengths of noisy quantum devices, hybrid algorithms have been suggested whereby quantum computers are used in tandem with their classical counterparts in a heterogeneous fashion. This modus operandi calls out for a programming model and a high-level programming language that natively and seamlessly supports heterogeneous quantum-classical hardware architectures in a single-source-code paradigm. Motivated by the lack of such a model, we introduce a language extension specification, called {QCOR} , which enables single-source quantum-classical programming. Programs written using the {QCOR} library–based language extensions can be compiled to produce functional hybrid binary executables. After defining {QCOR}’s programming model, memory model, and execution model, we discuss how {QCOR} enables variational, iterative, and feed-forward {QC}. {QCOR} approaches quantum-classical computation in a hardware-agnostic heterogeneous fashion and strives to build on best practices of high-performance computing. The high level of abstraction in the language extension is intended to accelerate the adoption of {QC} by researchers familiar with classical high-performance computing.},
